<font size="+1">Part B: Digit Gathering in Strings</font>

<p><b>Functional and Design Aspects</b>: Your program compiled and
linked successfully. In addition, your program met <u>most but not
all</u> of the following requirements:
  
  </p><ul>

    <li>Your program compiled without any warnings when
      the <tt>-Wall</tt> (report all warnings) flag was used.</li>
    
    <li>The <tt>gatherDigits</tt> method was correctly implemented to
      move digits to a given index while preserving order of all
      other characters and maintaining the order of the digits as
      they appeared in input [20 points].</li>

    <b>Breakdown:</b>
    <li>The <tt>single-character</tt> tests were passed. [5 points]</li>

    <li>The <tt>0-position</tt> tests were passed. [6 points]</li>
    
    <li>The <tt>spread-data</tt> tests were passed. [6 points]</li>
      
    <li>The <tt>in-bounds</tt> secondary test was passed. [2 points]</li>
    
  </ul>
  
<p></p>

<p><b>Design and Style</b>: Your program adhered to the stipulated
  requirements and recommended programming style guidelines, including
  the following requirements:
  
  </p><ul>
    
    <li>The program was organized into functions/methods to make
      maximum reuse of code. </li>
    
    <li>None of the methods in your program exceeded 25 lines of
      code.</li>
    
    <li>Each method used meaningful variable names appropriate to
      their functionality/usage.</li>
    
    <li>Overall the C++ methods/class has been properly formatted and
      indented.  Each method has appropriate doxygen style
      documentation.  The code followed most the recommend CSE
      programming style guidelines, while adhering to the conventions
      stipulated in the homework document. </li>
</ul>
